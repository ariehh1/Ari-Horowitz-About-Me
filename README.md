# Ari-Horowitz-About-Me

This repository details my first Portfolio on GitHub.  For Homework assignment #1, I wanted to showcase three different sections towards earning my Coding Certification.  In the top right portion of the webpage, there is an About Me, Contact, and Portfolio tab to direct you towards my material.

This repository taught me the fundamental applications of HTML, CSS, and updating GitHub in real-time.  I dove deeper into the HTML and CSS concepts that we discussed during the first week of class such as structuring your HTML, aligning my content, and alternate best practices.  I took advantage and utilized the w3schools and csstricks resources along with our class Slack communication channel to persevere.

As a future web developer, I hope to finetune my skill set by working with my classmates and learning from their techniques.  I want to be employer competitive once I earn the certification and this repository is the first building block towards achieving that goal.
