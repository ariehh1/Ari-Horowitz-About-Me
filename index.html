<p>I am currently taking the UW Coding Certification for a new challenge and opportunity to expand my skillset. 
    In my sparetime, I enjoy playing basketball, OrangeTheory Fitness, and listening to music. 
    This past spring, I took a trip with my girlfriend to Switzerland. Visiting the Matterhorn was one of the most amazing sights
    I've ever witnessed. My travel goal is to visit one new country a year!</p>

<p> After completing my Coding Certification, I will be looking forward to surveying the software development job market.
    In this first portion of the course material, I have gravitated towards the front end development pieces and enjoy the aesthetics
    and positioning elements within a webpage. I'm also interested in learning more about the storage functionalities of
    large tech companies and how their code structure layers in security measures.</p>
